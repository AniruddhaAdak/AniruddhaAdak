# 👋 Howdy! I'm Aniruddha Adak

**Full-Stack Developer | Code Wrangler | Professional Coffee Consumer**

Welcome to my GitHub abode! I'm Aniruddha, a developer who believes in the power of code, caffeine, and a good laugh. When I'm not busy debugging (or creating bugs), you'll find me exploring the latest tech trends or perfecting my coffee brewing skills.

## 🚀 Who Am I?

- 🎓 Currently surviving (and occasionally thriving) as a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at Budge Budge Institute of Technology (2022–2026). Proud owner of a YGPA of 8.45 in my first year—proof that caffeine works wonders.
- 💻 Fluent in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and other buzzwords that make me sound smarter than I am. I enjoy building user interfaces that are as smooth as my favorite brew and backends robust enough to handle my coffee consumption.
- 🌱 Always on the hunt for new technologies to tinker with. Recently, AI and UI/UX design have piqued my interest—because who doesn't want machines to look good while they take over the world?
- 🎯 Aspiring open-source contributor and collaborator. Let's join forces and make the web a better (and funnier) place.

## 🛠️ My Arsenal

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Design:** Figma, Adobe XD
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Other:** Docker, REST APIs, GraphQL
